## :gear: Usage

<!-- template:begin:goget -->
<!-- do not edit anything in this "template" block, its auto-generated -->
```console
go get -u github.com/lrstanley/chix@latest
```
<!-- template:end:goget -->

## :sparkles: Features

- `http.Server` wrapper that easily allows starting, and gracefully shutting
  down your http server, and other background services, using `errgroup`.
- RealIP middleware (supports whitelisting specific proxies, rather than allowing
  any source).
- private IP middleware, restricting endpoints to be internal only.
- Rendering helpers:
  - `JSON` (with `?pretty=true` support).
- Auth middleware:
  - Uses [markbates/goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) to support many
    different providers.
  - Encrypts session cookies, which removes the need for local session storage.
  - Uses Go 1.18's generics functionality to provide a custom ID and auth object
    resolver.
    - No longer have to type assert to your local models!
  - Optionally requiring authentication.
  - Optionally requiring specific roles.
  - Optionally adding authentication info to context for use by children handlers.
  - API key validation.
  - API version validation.
- Struct/type binding, from get/post data, with support for [go-playground/validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator).
- Structured logging using [apex/log](https://github.com/apex/log) (same API
  as logrus).
  - Allows injecting additional metadata into logs.
  - Injects logger into context for use by children handlers.
- Debug middleware:
  - Easily let children handlers know if global debug flags are enabled.
  - Allows masking errors, unless debugging is enabled.
- Error handler, that automatically handles api-vs-static content responses.
  - Supports `ErrorResolver`'s, providing the ability to override status codes
    for specific types of errors.
- `go:embed` helpers for mounting an embedded filesystem seamlessly as an http
  endpoint.
  - Useful for projects that bundle their frontend assets in their binary.
  - Supports local filesystem reading, when debugging is enabled (TODO).
- Middleware for robots.txt and security.txt responding.

## :zap: Related Libraries

- [lrstanley/clix](https://github.com/lrstanley/clix) -- go-flags wrapper, that
  handles parsing and decoding, with additional helpers.
- [lrstanley/go-query-parser](https://github.com/lrstanley/go-queryparser) -- similar
  to that of Google/Github/etc search, a query string parser that allows filters
  and tags to be dynamically configured by the end user.
